0x08. Making Change

For the “0. Change comes from within” project, you will tackle a classic problem from the domain of dynamic programming and greedy algorithms: the coin change problem. The objective is to find the minimum number of coins required to make up a given total amount, given a list of coin denominations. This project challenges you to apply your understanding of algorithms to devise a solution that is not only correct but also efficient. Below are the key concepts and resources necessary to complete this project successfully.
